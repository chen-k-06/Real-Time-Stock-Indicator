     * @brief Computes the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of a price series.
     *
     * This function calculates the SMA over a sliding window of the given size.
     * It returns a dynamically allocated array of SMA values, where each element
     * corresponds to the average of `window` consecutive prices.
     *
     * An SMA is a type of moving average (MA). Moving averages are calculated to identify the trend direction of a stock.
     * It is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it's based on past prices.
     * The longer the period for the moving average, the greater the lag.
     * Fifty-day and 200-day moving average figures are widely followed and considered to be important trading signals.
     * Shorter moving averages are typically used for short-term trading, while longer-term moving averages are more suited for long-term investors.
     *
     * @param prices Pointer to an array of double representing the price series.
     * @param length The total number of prices in the array.
     * @param window The size of the moving average window (number of periods).
     *
     * @return Pointer to a dynamically allocated array of doubles containing
     *         the SMA values. The length of this array is `length - window + 1`.
     *         Returns NULL if input parameters are invalid or if memory allocation fails.
     *
     * @note Caller is responsible for freeing the returned array.
